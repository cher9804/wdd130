        <p> Hi guys. This is Cristian Hernandez, I am an enthusiastic and lifelong learner person with over 3 years of experience in Sales and Customer Success. Right now I am studying Software Development, expecting to switch my career into Tachnology. Even though, I like taking time for myself by reading and applying techniques for personal growth.
