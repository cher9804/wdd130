    <p>
      This is Cristian Hernandez. I am an enthusiastic and lifelong learner with over 3 years of experience in Sales and
      Customer Success. Throughout my career, I’ve cultivated strong communication and problem-solving skills, which
      have helped me build lasting relationships with clients and drive results.
      Right now, I am on an exciting journey studying Software Development, aiming to transition my career into the
      technology industry. I’m particularly drawn to how technology empowers people and businesses to grow and thrive in
      today’s fast-paced world. My goal is to combine my background in sales with technical expertise to create
      innovative solutions that make a difference.
      Outside of work and studies, I value taking time for myself. I enjoy reading books on personal growth and applying
      techniques that improve my mindset and productivity. Whether it’s diving into a new hobby, exploring different
      cultures, or simply reflecting on life’s lessons, I always strive to grow as an individual.
      Feel free to connect with me—I’d love to share ideas, discuss pportunities, or simply have a great conversation.
      Let’s make an impact together!

      Colombia is a diverse and vibrant country in South America, known for its rich culture, music like vallenato and
      cumbia, stunning landscapes ranging from Caribbean beaches to the Andes mountains, and its delicious cuisine,
      including arepas, bandeja paisa, and world-class coffee. It also stands out for its history, warm people, and
      exceptional biodiversity.
