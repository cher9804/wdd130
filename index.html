        <p> Hi guys. This is Cristian Hernandez, I am an enthusiastic and lifelong learner person with over 3 years of experience in Sales and Customer Success. Right now I am studying Software Development, expecting to switch my career into Tachnology. Even though, I like taking time for myself by reading and applying techniques for personal growth.

        Colombia is a diverse and vibrant country in South America, known for its rich culture, music like vallenato and cumbia, stunning landscapes ranging from Caribbean beaches to the Andes mountains, and its delicious cuisine, including arepas, bandeja paisa, and world-class coffee. It also stands out for its history, warm people, and exceptional biodiversity.
